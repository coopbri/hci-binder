    "Correlation analysis is a method of statistical evaluation used to study the strength of a relationship between two variables. This particular type of analysis is useful when a researcher wants to establish if there are possible connections between variables. It is often misunderstood that correlation analysis determines cause and effect; however, this is not the case because other variables that are not present in the research may have impacted on the results.\n",
    "If correlation is found between two variables it means that when there is a systematic change in one variable, there is also a systematic change in the other; the variables alter together over a certain period of time. \n",
    "Positive correlation exists if one variable increases simultaneously with the other.\n",
    "Negative correlation exists if one variable decreases when the other increases.\n",
    "In the previous example, You see that, as the poverty rate goes higher, the crime rate goes higher too. So, you can find a positive correlation between poverty and crime rate in Detroit area. \n",
