    "Correlation analysis is a method of statistical evaluation used to study the strength of a relationship between two variables. This particular type of analysis is useful when a researcher wants to establish if there are possible connections between variables. It is often misunderstood that correlation analysis determines cause and effect; however, this is not the case because other variables that are not present in the research may have impacted on the results.\n",
