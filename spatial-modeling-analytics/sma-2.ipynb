    "Proximity Analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the relationship between a selected point and its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most basic questions asked of spatial data analysis is **\"what's near what?\"** For example:\n",
    "- How close is this well to a landfill?\n",
    "- What is the distance between two locations?\n",
    "- What is the nearest or farthest feature from something?\n",
    "- What is the distance between each feature in a layer and the features in another layer?\n",
    "- What is the shortest street network route from some location to another?\n",

    "There are some methods that you can analyze the proximity of points and their neighbors. Let's find out. "

    "\n",
    "For feature data, the Proximity methods can be used to discover proximity relationships. Buffers are usually used to delineate protected zones around features or to show areas of influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might buffer a school by one mile and use the buffer to select all the students that live more than one mile from the school to plan for their transportation to and from school. You could use the multi ring buffer tool to classify the areas around a feature into near, moderate distance, and long distance classes for an analysis. Buffers are sometimes used to clip data to a given study area or to exclude features within a critical distance of something from further consideration in an analysis. \n",
