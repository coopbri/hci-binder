    "Mental maps are a mix of objective knowledge and subjective perceptions from a personâ€™s point of view of a particular place. They are built from our knowledge about the location of geographic features as well as impressions of places, rough estimates of size and location, and a general sense of the connections between places. Therefore places are unique to our perception and build from experience and engagement with a place. In this exercise we will explore the mental maps of four individuals knowledge and perception of the island of Samothrace in Northeastern Greece. \n",
