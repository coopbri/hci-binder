Optional: animation where user clicks to zoom from a global perspective (globe+satellites) into local [real] person perspective (person+cell+sun), and 2 way data lines between cell and globe emerge, colored dots representing apps emerge on the the cell phone. This slide is intended to represent global connectedness via big data (used every day to come up in next slide), in a positive way.\n"
