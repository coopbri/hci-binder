Just as we saw with Parker and Patricia if they are both working to plant their portion of the field simultaneously the entire field is planted faster. If only Patricia is planting the field and Parker is not helping, then it takes longer because she is doing all of the work and Parker is doing no work. This is improper load balancing. The same is true in parallel computation. If we have two or more cores that are capable of processing data and we only use one core, then the other cores are not helping to speed up the computation."
